# Cats
###### Page 1
I am a crazy cat man. I have four cats. Their names are Romeo, Benny, Presley, and Elsa. 
The first two are my buddies; they come hang out in my room every day. 
I keep my door closed at night, so when I open my door in the morning Romeo runs right past me and straight to the window.
